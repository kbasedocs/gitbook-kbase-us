## Responsive Image Sizing

For webpages viewed on a larger screen i.e., computer, the maximum width is 800px.&#x20;

If image width is greater than 800px

`width=”100%” height=”auto”`

If width is less than 800px

`max-width=”100%” height=”auto”`

If width is not 800px or greater, but you want to set a specific maximum size.&#x20;

`width=”100%” max-width=”nnnpx” height=”auto”`

## Creating boxes around text

`<p style="border: Npx; border-style:solid; border-color: #HTMLtag; padding: 1em;"> text here </p>`

Teal boxes for developer highlights are 5px and #009688.&#x20;
