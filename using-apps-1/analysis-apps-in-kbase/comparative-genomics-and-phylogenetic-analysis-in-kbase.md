# Comparative Genomics and Phylogenetic Analysis in KBase

![](../../.gitbook/assets/comparative.jpg) KBase’s comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis tools enable researchers to understand evolutionary relationships between organisms and explore structural and functional variance across genomes. By integrating public datasets with user data and tools to search for sequence homology, explore gene orthology, and construct phylogenetic linkages between organisms, KBase provides an advanced and useful platform for comparative genomics research.

### KBase Comparative Genomics and Phylogenetic Analysis Capabilities

#### Phylogenetic Analysis

#### Sequence Homology

* Search and compare translated protein sequences via BLASTx, tBLASTn, and tBLASTx
* Search and compare nucleotide sequences via BLASTn
* Search and compare protein sequences via BLASTp and psiBLAST
* Build and analyze multiple sequence alignments \(MSA\) for nucleotide or protein sequences via MUSCLE

#### Pangenome Exploration

### **Phylogenetic Analysis Apps**

* Reconstruct a phylogenetic tree based on conserved orthologous groups using [Insert Genome Into Species Tree](https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog/app/l.m/insert_set_of_genomes_into_species_tree_generic)
* Examine functional content using _View Function Profile for Genomes_ and _View Function Profile Phylo_
* Compare proteomes and produce a synteny map dot plot matrix and table of gene differences with [Compare Two Proteomes](https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog/app/l.m/compare_two_proteomes_generic)
