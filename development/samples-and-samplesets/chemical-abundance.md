# Chemical Abundance

## What is chemical abundance data?

## Uploading to KBase

As with amplicon data, chemical abundance data works best with an existing SampleSet. If there is already a SampleSet to apply the chemical abundance data, a template can be generated using the "Create Chemical Abundance Matrix Template" app. This app generates a spreadsheet onto which you can copy your data to ensure it links to the SampleSet when it is uploaded. The app allows you to select chemical data to be included, such as aggregate M/Z, compound name, predicted formula, and more, depending on what data you have for upload. You can also select which chemical IDs to include in the template from KEGG, ChEBI, and ModelSEED. 

Once the template has been generated and you added your data, you can upload it using the "Import Chemical Abundance Matrix from CSV/Excel/TSV File in Staging Area" app.
