# Samples Formats

### IGSN SESAR

The SESAR \(System for Earth SAmple Registration\) format is one format that can be used in KBase for uploading Samples. Their samples have a controlled vocabulary for the various fields of data and metadata that can be included in SESAR samples. See their [vocabularies documentation page](https://www.geosamples.org/help/vocabularies) for a description of each of the fields. 

You can download a template of the SESAR format below and fill with your own data, or generate a new one from scratch based on their documentation linked above. The .xlsx file has pre-filled options for the columns with controlled vocabulary, whereas the CSV file is a much smaller file that only contains a heading with the possible fields.
