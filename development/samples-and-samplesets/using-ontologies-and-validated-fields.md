# Using Ontologies and Validated Fields

### Introduction

When uploading Samples to KBase, there are many metadata terms that are built in and can be validated. Doing so allows your data to be more easily compared with other data and allows us to integrate data when different sources may use different conventions. 

### Validated Metadata

The file TSV file below contains a list of the metadata fields that are currently supported for validation along with a description that provides general formatting direction, such as units of measure. You can view the most up-to-date version of this list on the project GitHub. 

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/metadata\_validation.tsv" caption="Validated Metadata TSV" %}

### Ontology Landing Pages

The Ontology API supports multiple ontology systems. Currently supported systems are Gene Ontology \(GO\) and Environmental Ontology \(ENVO\). You can see more information on both ontologies from their own home pages, or view the KBase landing page for a given ontology page with the links and URL format below \(respectively\).

* Gene Ontology \(GO\) - [http://geneontology.org](http://geneontology.org)
