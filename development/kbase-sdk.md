# The KBase SDK

## Information for Developers

The [KBase Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://kbase.github.io/kb\_sdk\_docs/) offers members of the KBase community a mechanism to add open-source, open-license (as [defined by OSI](https://opensource.org/licenses)) analysis tools to KBase so that they run on [KBase’s computational architecture](https://github.com/kbase/KBaseDeveloperBootstrap/blob/master/README.md) and are available through the [KBase Narrative Interface](https://narrative.kbase.us/). Community developers can write new tools that take advantage of the [KBase Structured Data Types](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/datatypes) and large[ KBase Reference Data Resources](https://www.kbase.us/data-policy-and-sources/). Check which tools have already been made available in our [App Catalog](https://kbase.us/applist/) and add your own!
