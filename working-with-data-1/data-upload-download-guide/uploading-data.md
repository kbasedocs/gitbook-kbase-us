# Uploading Data

## **New upload interface**

The new Import tab lets you drag & drop data from your computer into your Staging Area to import into your Narrative, where you can then analyze it using KBase’s analysis apps. Please see [this page](../../getting-started/narrative-user-guide/add-data-to-your-narrative.md#uploading-data-from-external-sources) of the Narrative User Guide for general instructions on how to use the Staging Import.

The first step in uploading your data is to locate the Data Panel along the left side of the Narrative Interface window and click either the “Add Data” button, the red “+” button, or the right arrow at the upper right of the panel to access the slideout Data Browser. The Data Browser has several tabs that allow you to access data already in KBase, as well as the “Import” tab for importing your own data. 

**Please see** [**this page of the Narrative Guide**](../../getting-started/narrative-user-guide/add-data-to-your-narrative.md#uploading-data-from-external-sources) **for instructions on using the new \(early 2018\) import tab.**

To close the Import panel and return to the Narrative Interface, simply click the “Close” button on the bottom right of the import panel. If you have a small screen, you might not be able to see that button. Another way to close the Data Browser is to click the arrow on the top right of your Data Panel \(the same one that opens the Data Browser slideout\).

## **Data privacy**

Any data that you upload to KBase is kept private unless you choose to share it. You can share any of your Narratives \(including their associated data\) with one or more specific users, or make it publicly available to all KBase users. Please see the [Sharing](../../getting-started/narrative-user-guide/share-narratives.md) page for more information about how to do that. The [Terms and Conditions page](http://kbase.us/terms-and-conditions/) describes the KBase data policy.  


The next sections of this guide describe the specific steps involved in uploading the currently supported data types, and show examples for each type.

## **Transferring JGI data to KBase**

If you are a JGI user, you can transfer public genome reads and assemblies \(as well as your private data and annotated genomes\) from JGI to your KBase account—see [this page](../transferring-data-from-jgi.md) for instructions.
