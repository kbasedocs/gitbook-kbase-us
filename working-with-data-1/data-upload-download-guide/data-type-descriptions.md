# Data Type Descriptions

Data in KBase covers a wide range of data types relevant to systems biology research, including genomes and their annotations, metagenomes, expression and protein-protein interaction data, inferred models of organismal and community metabolism and gene regulation, and even geographical information about populations. By “data type”, we mean the internal KBase representation of a particular sort of biological data. 

The [Data Type Catalog](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/datatypes) lists and describes the key data types in KBase.
