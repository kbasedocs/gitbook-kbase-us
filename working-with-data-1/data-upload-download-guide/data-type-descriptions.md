# Data Type Descriptions

Data within KBase covers a wide range of data types relevant to systems biology research, including genomes and their annotations, metagenomes, expression, and protein-protein interactions, inferred models of organismal and community metabolism and gene regulation, even geographical information about populations. By “data type”, we mean the internal KBase representation of a particular sort of biological data. 

The [Data Type Catalog](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/datatypes) lists and describes the key data types in KBase.
