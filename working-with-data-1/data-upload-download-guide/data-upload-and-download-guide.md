# Data Upload and Download Guide

## **Importing data into the Staging Area**

The _Import_ tab lets you drag & drop data from your computer into your Staging Area to import into your Narrative, where you can then run analysis using KBase apps. Please see [this page](../../getting-started/narrative-user-guide/add-data-to-your-narrative.md#uploading-data-from-external-sources) of the Narrative User Guide for detailed instructions on how to use the Staging Area.

## **Public Data in KBase**

KBase periodically imports [data from many publicly accessible databases](../public-data-in-kbase.md#data-summary) and allows users to upload their own datasets for analysis. Data uploaded by a KBase user is stored within that individualâ€™s account and can only be accessed by others if the owner includes the data in a shared or public Narrative. After performing analyses using [KBase apps](../../using-apps-1/analysis-apps-in-kbase/#apps), the results can be downloaded in several standard formats. If you have requests for more download formats, please [contact us](http://kbase.us/contact-us/).
