# Data Upload and Download Guide

## **Uploading and Downloading Your Own Data**

This guide provides instructions for uploading different types of data to your KBase account and downloading output data from your analysis results.

## **Learn about KBase's new Staging Import**

The new Import tab lets you drag & drop data from your computer into your Staging Area to import into your Narrative, where you can then analyze it using KBase’s analysis apps. Please see [this page](../../getting-started/narrative-user-guide/add-data-to-your-narrative.md#uploading-data-from-external-sources) of the Narrative User Guide for instructions on how to use the Staging Import.

## **Public Data in KBase**

KBase periodically imports [data from many publicly accessible databases](../public-data-in-kbase.md#data-summary) and also allows users to upload their own datasets for analysis. Data uploaded by a KBase user is stored within that individual’s account and can only be accessed by others if the owner includes the data in a shared or public Narrative. After performing analyses using [KBase apps](../../using-apps-1/analysis-apps-in-kbase/#apps), the results can be downloaded to your computer in several standard formats. If you have requests for more download formats, please [contact us](http://kbase.us/contact-us/).
