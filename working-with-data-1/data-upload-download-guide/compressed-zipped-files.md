# Compressed/Zipped Files

### Compressed Format Types

Data uploaders accept compressed files in these formats: .zip, .gz, .bz, .bzip2, .bz2, .tar, .tgz. 

### Uploading and Importing Compressed Files

To add compressed data files from your computer to the KBase Narrative, follow the same three-step process for all data files. 

1. Drag & drop the data file\(s\) from your computer to the new Import tab to upload them to your Staging Area.
2. Choose a format for importing data from your Staging Area into your Narrative.
3. Run the Import app that is created.

When files have been uploaded to the Staging Area, compressed files have an outward-facing double arrow icon to the left of the file name.

Click the uncompress icon to the left of the file name to uncompress the compressed/zip uploaded files before clicking the import icon. To ensure this works, the file extension must match the type of packing/compression.
