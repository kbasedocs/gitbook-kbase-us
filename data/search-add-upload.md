# Searching, Adding, and Uploading Data

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7-iCVaAMrg" %}

You can add data to a Narrative through a variety of methods. The **Data Browser** allows you to search data in KBase or import data from your computer or a database.

* _My Data_ tab shows your data objects available within Narratives.&#x20;
* The _Shared With Me_ displays data in Narratives shared with you.&#x20;
* The _Public_ tabs display Public datasets.
* The _Example_ tab shows datasets that have been pre-loaded by the KBase team.&#x20;
* The _Import_ tab allows you to upload your own datasets or external datasets for analysis.

Add data by navigating to the Data Browser tab and hover over the data object to reveal the _<_ _Add_ button. Click on the _< Add_ button to import the data object into the Narrative. Now you can view the data object and run analysis.&#x20;
