# Searching, Adding, and Uploading Data

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7-iCVaAMrg" %}

You can add data to a Narrative through a variety of methods. The **Data Browser** allows you to search data in KBase or import data from your computer or a database.

* _My Data_ shows your data objects available within Narratives.&#x20;
* _Shared With Me_ includes data associated to Narratives shared with you.&#x20;
* _Public_ displays Public datasets.
* _Example_ shows datasets that have been pre-loaded by the KBase team.&#x20;
* _Import_ allows you to upload your own datasets or external datasets for analysis.

Add data by navigating to the Data Browser tab and hover over the data object to reveal the _<_ _Add_ button. Click on the "_< Add_" button to import the data object into the Narrative. Now you can view the data object and run analysis.&#x20;
