# Public Data in KBase

KBase provides users with a unified resource for analyzing a range of public data together with the data generated from their own experiments. The data in KBase, which includes public data from various public sources as well as internally-generated analysis results, consists of an extensive set of prokaryotic annotated genomes; a selected set of eukaryotic genomes; and thousands of biochemical compounds and reactions.

Please review [KBase's Data Policy](https://kbase.us/data-policy-and-sources/) and the sources of our public reference data.

To search public data in KBase, use the __[_Public_ tab in the **Data Browser** ](../getting-started/narrative/explore-data.md) ****within the Narrative Interface.

If you are a JGI user, you can transfer public genome reads and assemblies \(as well as your private data and annotated genomes\) from JGI to your KBase account using [these instructions](jgi-transfer.md).
