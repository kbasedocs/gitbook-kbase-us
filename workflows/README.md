# Running Common Workflows

Here is an example outline of the major workflows and datatypes in KBase. The unboxed labels represent datatypes, while each colored box represents a single KBase App. The box colors signify the category of functionality, and the numbers in parentheses indicate the number of alternative apps that implement each function. Apps that require a genome as input are marked with a green “G” icon.
