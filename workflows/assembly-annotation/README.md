# Assembling and Annotating Microbial Genomes

KBase enables _de novo_ assembly of prokaryotic NGS reads from various sequencing platforms. Assemblies can then be annotated with RAST or Prokka, enabling you to explore structural and functional features of a Genome or use it in other analyses. 

The steps for [assembly](https://kbase.us/applist/#Genome%20Assembly) and [annotation](https://kbase.us/applist/#Genome%20Annotation) include:

* Import or upload reads to assemble with the Narrative Interface Data Browser.
* Add the Reads data object to the Narrative.
* Find and insert the Assemble Contigs from Reads App.
  * Use this App to assemble an example set of reads into a set of contigs \(an Assembly object\).
* Find and insert the Annotate Microbial Contigs App.
  * Use this App to annotate the Assembly.
* Examine assembly job statistics and genome annotation.
