# Comparative Genomics and Phylogenetic Analysis

KBase’s comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis [tools](https://kbase.us/applist/#Comparative%20Genomics) enable researchers to understand evolutionary relationships between organisms and explore structural and functional variance across genomes. By integrating public datasets with user data and tools to search for sequence homology, explore gene orthology, and construct phylogenetic linkages between organisms, KBase provides an advanced and useful platform for comparative genomics research.

### Comparative and Phylogenetic Analysis Tutorials

* [Build a Gene Tree ](https://narrative.kbase.us/narrative/ws.22290.obj.1)– guides the user through the process of building a gene tree for the "Sulfate Adenylyltransferase" \(Sat\) gene from Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator MP104C
* [Phylogenomics of Sulfate Reducing Clostridia - Tutorial - Part 1: Comparative Functional Assignment](https://narrative.kbase.us/narrative/ws.18988.obj.1) – guides the user through the process of whole-genome phylogeny, homology, and domain family functional profiling.
* [Genome Analysis Tools and Features](https://narrative.kbase.us/narrative/48493) – demonstrates some workflows for comparative analysis of genomes, including searching for features, annotating protein families, and performing phylogenetic analysis.
