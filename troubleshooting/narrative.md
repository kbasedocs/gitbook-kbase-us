# Problems with the User Interface

### If you experience problems with KBase’s Narrative user interface \(e.g., data, apps, or viewers won’t load or the interface appears to be frozen\), here are a few things to try that may help:

* See our list of [recommended web browsers](../getting-started/browsers.md#supported-browsers) to make sure your browser is supported by KBase.
* Try a hard reload of your Narrative \(shift-reload in your browser window\).
* Log out of KBase and log in again.
* Clear your browser cache or open the Narrative Interface in an “incognito” or “private” browser window.
* Select the “Shutdown and Restart” option in the menu at the top left of the Narrative Interface. A popup will ask you to confirm that you want to restart the Narrative Interface and remind you to save your latest changes.

### What should I do if my Narrative freezes or won’t load properly?

* See our list of [recommended browsers](../getting-started/browsers.md#supported-browsers) to ensure yours is supported by KBase.
* Try a hard reload \(shift-reload in your browser window\).
* If you’ve used earlier versions of KBase, they may be lurking in your cache and messing things up. Try either clearing your cache or [launching KBase](https://narrative.kbase.us/) from an “incognito” or “anonymous” window \(which doesn’t use your cache\).
* Shut down and restart your Narrative by selecting this option from the top left menu of the Narrative Interface.
