# Help Board

## Contact Us

The [KBase Help Board](https://kbase-jira.atlassian.net/jira/) is an interactive way for users to report bugs, ask questions, or suggest new features, using an issue tracking system called Jira.

Using the [Help Board](https://kbase-jira.atlassian.net/), you’ll be able to:

* [Submit bug reports, questions and suggestions](report.md) without revealing your email address
* Engage in a two-way dialog with KBase staff as they track down and resolve your issue
* Search the issues submitted by other users. If someone else has already reported your problem or suggested the same new feature, you can vote for that issue or add a “Me too!” comment.
* Increase your productivity in KBase by seeing other users’ suggestions and workarounds

See [Using the KBase Help Board](https://kbase-jira.atlassian.net/jira/) to find out how to sign up and submit your bug reports, questions and suggestions to us.
