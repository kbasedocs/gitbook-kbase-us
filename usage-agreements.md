When signing up for a KBase account, you accept the [KBase Terms & Conditions](https://www.kbase.us/terms-and-conditions/), which includes our Data Policy, Privacy Policy, Use Agreement, Code of Conduct, and Service Level Agreement.&#x20;

### Data Policy

See the [KBase Data Policy & Sources](https://www.kbase.us/data-policy-and-sources/) page for details, including information on publicly available data.&#x20;

### Privacy Policy

_All data uploaded by users is private to them unless they choose to share it_. KBase does not release or use private data for any internal analyses, with the exception of collecting metrics on 1) amount of data and 2) the distribution of data types in system, and 3) app usage across system as an aggregate of user activity.

### Use Agreement & Code of Conduct

Users will follow the [KBase Use Agreement](https://www.kbase.us/use-agreement/), which outlines the above policies around data and privacy and the [KBase Code of Conduct](https://www.kbase.us/kbase-code-of-conduct/), which outlines expectations of how users and the KBase team respect each other and collaborate.  &#x20;

### Service Level Agreement & Compute Resources

KBase compute resources are available in a fair sharing system that enables equitable access for all users to KBase compute resources. If a user submits multiple jobs at once, they are staggered in the job queue with other users. This means that some jobs may take longer to finish than if they were submitted alone.&#x20;
