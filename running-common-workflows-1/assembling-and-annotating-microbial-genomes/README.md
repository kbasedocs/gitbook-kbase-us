# Assembling and Annotating Microbial Genomes

KBase enables _de novo_ assembly of prokaryotic NGS reads from various sequencing platforms. Assemblies can then be annotated with RAST or Prokka, enabling you to explore structural and functional features of a Genome or use it in other analyses. 

The steps for assembly and annotation include:

* Find a set of reads to assemble using the Narrative Interface Data Browser.
* Add the reads to our Narrative.
* Find and insert the Assemble Contigs from Reads app into our Narrative.
* Use this app to assemble an example set of reads into a set of contigs \(an Assembly object\).
* Find and insert the Annotate Microbial Contigs app into our Narrative.
* Use this app to annotate our Assembly.
* Examine assembly job statistics and genome annotation.
