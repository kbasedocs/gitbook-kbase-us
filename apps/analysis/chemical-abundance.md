# Chemical Abundance

## Data Cleaning and Statistical Analysis

As both chemical abundance and amplicon matrices are similar, similar apps for cleaning, normalizing, and performing statistical comparisons can be done on both types. See the previous page on [Data Matrices](matrix.md) for information on using these apps.

## Popular Use Cases of Chemical Abundance Data

You can view a few public Narratives that demonstrate popular use cases for chemical abundance tables in KBase.
