# Comparative Genomics and Phylogenetics

KBase provides multiple comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis [Apps](https://kbase.us/applist/#Comparative%20Genomics) to enable researchers to understand evolutionary relationships between organisms and explore structural and functional variance across genomes.

### **Phylogenetic Analysis**

* Reconstruct a phylogenetic tree based on conserved orthologous groups using [Insert Genome Into Species Tree](https://kbase.us/applist/apps/SpeciesTreeBuilder/insert\_set\_of\_genomes\_into\_species\_tree/release)
* Examine functional content using [View Function Profile for Genomes](https://kbase.us/applist/apps/kb\_phylogenomics/view\_fxn\_profile/release) and [View Function Profile for a Phylogenetic Tree](https://kbase.us/applist/apps/kb\_phylogenomics/view\_fxn\_profile\_phylo/release)
* Compare proteomes and produce a synteny map dot plot matrix and table of gene differences with [Compare Two Proteomes](https://kbase.us/applist/apps/GenomeProteomeComparison/compare\_two\_proteomes/release)
* View the pangenome in a phylogenetic context using [Phylogenetic Pangenome Accumulation](https://kbase.us/applist/apps/kb\_phylogenomics/view\_pan\_phylo/release)

### Sequence Homology

* Search and compare translated protein sequences via [BLASTx](https://kbase.us/applist/apps/kb\_blast/BLASTx\_Search/release), [tBLASTn](https://kbase.us/applist/apps/kb\_blast/tBLASTn\_Search/release), and [tBLASTx](https://kbase.us/applist/apps/kb\_blast/tBLASTx\_Search/release)
* Search and compare nucleotide sequences via [BLASTn](https://kbase.us/applist/apps/kb\_blast/BLASTn\_Search/release)
* Search and compare protein sequences via [BLASTp](https://kbase.us/applist/apps/kb\_blast/BLASTp\_Search/release) and [psiBLAST](https://kbase.us/applist/apps/kb\_blast/psiBLAST\_msa\_start\_Search/release)
* Build and analyze multiple sequence alignments (MSA) for [nucleotide](https://kbase.us/applist/apps/kb\_muscle/MUSCLE\_nuc/release) or [protein](https://kbase.us/applist/apps/kb\_muscle/MUSCLE\_prot/release) sequences via MUSCLE

### **Pangenome Exploration**&#x20;

* &#x20;[Build Pangenome with OrthoMCL](https://kbase.us/applist/apps/PangenomeOrthomcl/build\_pangenome\_with\_orthomcl/release) – Group orthologous protein sequences and identify core and non-core genes across multiple species
* [Compute Pangenome](https://kbase.us/applist/apps/GenomeComparisonSDK/build\_pangenome/release) – Build a pangenome and evaluate protein family conservation&#x20;
* [Pangenome Circle Plot ](https://kbase.us/applist/apps/kb\_phylogenomics/view\_pan\_circle\_plot/release) __ – View a microbial pangenome as a circle plot using &#x20;
* [Compare Genomes from Pangenome](https://kbase.us/applist/apps/GenomeComparisonSDK/compare\_genomes/release) __ – Compare isofunctional and homologous gene families within a pangenome&#x20;
