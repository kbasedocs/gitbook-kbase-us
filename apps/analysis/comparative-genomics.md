# Comparative Genomics and Phylogenetics

KBase provides multiple comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis [Apps](https://kbase.us/applist/#Comparative%20Genomics) to enable researchers to understand evolutionary relationships between organisms and explore structural and functional variance across genomes.

### **Phylogenetic Analysis**

* Reconstruct a phylogenetic tree based on conserved orthologous groups using [Insert Genome Into Species Tree](https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog/app/l.m/insert_set_of_genomes_into_species_tree_generic)
* Examine functional content using _View Function Profile for Genomes_ and _View Function Profile Phylo_
* Compare proteomes and produce a synteny map dot plot matrix and table of gene differences with [Compare Two Proteomes](https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog/app/l.m/compare_two_proteomes_generic)
* View the pangenome in a phylogenetic context using _Phylogenetic Pangenome Accumulation_

### Sequence Homology

* Search and compare translated protein sequences via [BLASTx](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/kb_blast/BLASTx_Search/release), [tBLASTn](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/kb_blast/tBLASTn_Search/release), and [tBLASTx](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/kb_blast/tBLASTx_Search/release)
* Search and compare nucleotide sequences via [BLASTn](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/kb_blast/BLASTn_Search/release)
* Search and compare protein sequences via [BLASTp](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/kb_blast/BLASTp_Search/release) and [psiBLAST](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/kb_blast/psiBLAST_msa_start_Search/release)
* Build and analyze multiple sequence alignments \(MSA\) for [nucleotide](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/kb_muscle/MUSCLE_nuc/release) or [protein](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/kb_muscle/MUSCLE_prot/release) sequences via MUSCLE

### **Pangenome Exploration** 

*  [Build Pangenome with OrthoMCL](https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog/app/PangenomeOrthomcl/build_pangenome_with_orthomcl/release) – Group orthologous protein sequences and identify core and non-core genes across multiple species
* [Compute Pangenome](https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog/app/l.m/compute_pangenome) – Build a pangenome and evaluate protein family conservation 
* [Pangenome Circle Plot ](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/kb_phylogenomics/view_pan_circle_plot/release) __– View a microbial pangenome as a circle plot using  
* [Compare Genomes from Pangenome](https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog/app/l.m/genome_comparison_from_pangenome)  __– Compare isofunctional and homologous gene families within a pangenome
