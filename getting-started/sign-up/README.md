# Signing Up and Signing In

## **Signing Up**

To create a KBase account, you will need to use one of our supported identity providers.

## **Signing In**

To sign in, click the Sign In button on the KBase website or KBase Narrative Interface. Select the identity provider you chose when you signed up for your KBase account, and use the credentials you would normally use when signing into the that provider's web site. You can [link multiple accounts to sign into KBase](linking-accounts.md).&#x20;

## How do I set or reset my password?

If you signed up for KBase and your password does not seem to work, you may reset your password at any time with the identity provider who manages it. KBase itself does not manage passwords of its own, so all password management must be done through your identity provider.

If the last time you logged into your KBase account was prior to June 2017, see the [authentication update page](auth-update.md).
