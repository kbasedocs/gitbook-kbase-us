# Authentication Update

KBase has simplified the sign up and sign in process for new users. You will be able to sign into KBase with a Google, Globus, or ORCiD once accounts have been linked.

### Transitioning an existing KBase account

If you already had a KBase account prior to June 9, 2017, then the first time you want to sign into KBase after the authentication change, you will need to go through a few steps to convert your existing KBase (through Globus) account to the new system. After going through the conversion, you’ll be able to sign in to KBase with your existing account or your Google account, if you choose to link your KBase account. To see what you’ll need to do, continue reading below.

When you go to [KBase](https://narrative.kbase.us/) to sign in, you will see this:

Click the Sign In button below “Use KBase” and sign-in options will appear

**Sign in using Globus**. Globus is the home of the existing KBase user accounts, and your Globus ID is your KBase ID.

When you click “[Sign in with Globus](https://www.globusid.org/login)”, a page to Log in with your Globus credentials will open:

Click Continue. You will reach another page at Globus, requesting your Globus username and password (remember, this is the same as your existing KBase account).

Enter your usual KBase username and password. Your username is not your email address – it should not contain an “@” sign. **If you forgot your password, use the “Forgot password?” link at the lower right.**

After entering your username and password, click the “Log In” button. You will be taken to a page where KBase requests access to your email address and Globus identities. Click the blue “Allow” button. We won’t share your email address or personal information outside of KBase.

You must now agree to the KBase User Agreement and KBase Data Policy. (The User Agreement and Data Policy have not changed since you last agreed to them. This is merely a reconfirmation required by the new authentication process.)

Read the [KBase User Agreement](https://www.kbase.us/about/terms-and-conditions-v2/#use\_agreement) and [KBase Data Policy ](https://www.kbase.us/about/terms-and-conditions-v2/#data\_policy)and check the checkboxes that say “I have read and agree to this policy”

Once you’ve checked both of the checkboxes, you will be able to click the blue button at the bottom that says “Continue to the KBase account \[username]”.

Once you click that Continue button, you’re done – you should see the KBase User Interface landing page.&#x20;

Note – the system changes mean that your profile may look a bit bare-bones. Please fill in the information in your profile when you get a chance, and choose or upload a new avatar if you like.

### The next time you sign in with your Globus account

The first time you sign into KBase after the authentication change, you will need to go through all the steps described above. Subsequently, if you choose to sign-in using your Google credentials, the process will look like this:

1\. Go to [narrative.kbase.us](https://narrative.kbase.us/)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/kbase\_login.png)

2\. Click the Sign In button below “Use KBase” and more options will appear:

3\. Click “Sign in with Globus”.&#x20;

Most of the time, you will not need to sign into Globus (as it will remember you unless you sign out of KBase), so you will see a screen like this:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2017-06-07-at-10.21.16-am.png)

4\. Click the blue button at the bottom that says “Sign in to KBase account \[username]” and you will be at your KBase landing page!

Note that if you had signed out completely from Globus after the last time you used KBase, you might have to go through two extra steps to sign-in to Globus. Click "Continue" and then proceed to enter Globus Log in information.&#x20;
