Linking Accounts can be helpful for data transfers, ease of signing in, and sharing data. You can link your KBase Account to Google, Globus, and ORCiD. 

To do this, ****first sign into KBase and go through the normal sign-in process.

On the left sidebar menu, click the “Account” icon, and then choose the tab labeled “Linked Sign-In Accounts”.
