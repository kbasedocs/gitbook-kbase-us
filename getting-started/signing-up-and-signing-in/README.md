# Signing Up and Signing In

### **Signing Up**

To create a KBase account, you will need to use one of our supported identity providers. Sign up for a free KBase account ****using your existing Google, ORCID, or Globus identity. For more detailed guidance, see the [Step-by-Step Signup Guide](step-by-step-signup-guide.md).

After you link your Google, ORCID, or Globus account, you will be able to sign in and use the KBase Narrative Interface to perform your computational systems biology analyses.

#### **Terms and Conditions**

KBase is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy and is free for all to use \(even if youâ€™re not in the U.S.\). When you link an identity to KBase, you will need to accept our [Terms & Conditions](https://kbase.us/terms-and-conditions/), including our [User Agreement](http://kbase.us/user-agreement). You may also want to review our [Privacy Policy](http://kbase.us/privacy-policy).

### **Signing In**

To sign in, click the Sign In button on the KBase website or KBase Narrative Interface. Select the identity provider you chose when you signed up for your KBase account, and use the credentials you would normally use when signing into the that provider's web site.

#### How do I set or reset my password?

If you signed up for KBase and your password does not seem to work, you may reset your password at any time with the identity provider who manages it. KBase itself does not manage passwords of its own, so all password management must be done through your identity provider. If you have an old KBase account \(before June 2017\), see the [authentication update page](https://kbase.us/auth-update-2017).
