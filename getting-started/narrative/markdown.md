# Formatting Markdown Cells

Add formatted text to your Narrative using [Markdown cells](revise.md#add-text-to-your-narrative) to explain your process, interpret results, and communicate to others for sharing and publication and more. 

Markdown cells use markup languages of Markdown and HTML. Both are pretty easy to learn but does require knowing some syntax. Not every formatting option will work in the Narrative Interface.
