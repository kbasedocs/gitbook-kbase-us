# Your Dashboard

After signing in to the Narrative Interface, you will be taken to your Dashboard, which provides an overview of your work in and use of KBase. From the Dashboard you can access existing Narratives, create new ones, contact collaborators, update your profile, and more.

Main features of the Dashboard are described below.

## What’s in my Dashboard?

**Narratives**

* There are five panels for exploring and locating existing Narratives: **Your Narratives, Tutorial Narratives, Narratives Shared with You,  Public Narratives, and Common Collaborator Network.**
* The most recently modified Narratives appear first in the panels.
* Click on any Narrative name to open it.
* Icons under a Narrative name indicate which apps the Narrative includes, how many markdown and code cells it contains, the number of times the Narrative has been shared, whether there are any running jobs, total running time for all completed jobs, and more.

* You can use the _Search Box_ at the top of each panel to find a particular Narrative within that category.
* In the **Your Narratives** panel, you can click the blue button at the top to create a new Narrative.

Note that **Public Narratives** have not necessarily been reviewed or tested by the KBase team; they are simply Narratives that have been made public by their owners

**Metrics**

* Snapshot that shows how you’re using the system \(e.g., how many Narratives you’ve created and shared compared to other users\).
* Other metrics will be added soon, as part of KBase’s expansion of its social features.

**Common Collaborator Network**

* People with whom you share Narratives.

## Where can I go from here?

The Dashboard offers many launch points. To the left of the **Your Narratives** panel you will see seven icons allowing you to toggle between the **Dashboard**, **Catalog**, **Search**, **Jobs**, **Account, and Feed** tabs.

* It also enables you to search for reads and assemblies contained in the Joint Genome Institute \(JGI\) Genomes Online Database \(GOLD\) and add them directly to your Narratives.

**Jobs**

* The **Job Browser** allows you to view apps that you have run recently, see their progress, search for specific runs, and more.
* You can filter the runs by _Finished_, _Queued_, _Running_, _Success_, and _Error_
* Query results also display basic information surround the runs such as the Narrative they can be found in, App ID, Submission Time, Queue Time, Run Time, and Status

**Account**

* From this tab you can also get to your **Profile Page** which gives an overview of your Narratives and your Collaborators.
