## Updated Tabs

**Narratives \('Your Dashboard'\)**

![Overview gif of selecting tabs and sorting](../../.gitbook/assets/narratives_overview.gif)

* There are five tabs for exploring and locating existing Narratives: **My Narratives, Shared with Me, Tutorials,** and **Public.**
* The most recently updated Narratives appear first, but can be searched or sorted using the dropdown menu - _Recently updated, Least recently updated, Recently created, Oldest, Lexographic \(A-Z\), Reverse Lexicographic \(Z-A\)_.
* A list of available Narratives will be on the left panel and information on the selected Narrative on the right panel. Here you can see an overview of the Data within the Narrative and a Preview.  
  * Icons under a Narrative name indicate which apps the Narrative includes, how many markdown and code cells it contains, the number of times the Narrative has been shared, whether there are any running jobs, total running time for all completed jobs, and more.
* Click on the selected Narrative name to open it.

* Note that **Public Narratives** have not necessarily been reviewed or tested by the KBase team; they are simply Narratives that have been made public by their owners.

## Where can I go from here?

The Dashboard offers many launch points. To the left of the **Your Narratives** panel you will see seven icons allowing you to toggle between the **Narratives**, **Orgs**, **Catalog**, **Search**, **Jobs**, **Account,** and **Feed** tabs.
