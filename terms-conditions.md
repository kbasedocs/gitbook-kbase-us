### Service Level Agreement & Compute Resources

KBase compute resources are available in a [fair-sharing system](https://batchdocs.web.cern.ch/fairshare/fairshare.html) that enables equitable access for all users to KBase compute resources. Submitted jobs, will be staggered in the job queue with other users based on [user priority](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-manual/priorities-and-preemption.html). This means that some jobs may take longer to finish based on previously submitted jobs and available machine slots.&#x20;

To check the status of the job queue and wait times for KBase Apps, view [the Job Log](getting-started/narrative/job-browser.md#job-log).&#x20;
