# Help Board

## Contact Us

The [KBase Help Board](https://kbase.us/help-board/) is an interactive way for users to report bugs, ask questions, or suggest new features, using an issue tracking system called Jira.

Using the [Help Board](https://kbase-jira.atlassian.net/), you’ll be able to:

* Submit bug reports, questions and suggestions without revealing your email address
* Engage in a two-way dialog with KBase staff as they track down and resolve your issue
* Search the issues submitted by other users. If someone else has already reported your problem or suggested the same new feature, you can vote for that issue or add a “Me too!” comment.
* Increase your productivity in KBase by seeing other users’ suggestions and workarounds

See [Using the KBase Help Board](https://kbase.us/help-board/) to find out how to sign up and submit your bug reports, questions and suggestions to us.

## **How to Report Problems**

Please look at the [issue reporting guidelines](https://kbase.us/report-an-issue/) before reporting an issue. Following these guidelines will help us help you faster!

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
